	<font color="orange"><p align="left">In online marketing, a
			shopping cart is a piece of e-commerce software on a web server that
			allows visitors to an Internet site to select items for eventual
			purchase, analogous to the American English term "shopping cart". In
			British English, it is generally known as a shopping basket, almost
			exclusively shortened on websites to "basket".</p> The software allows
		online shopping customers to accumulate a list of items for purchase,
		described metaphorically as “placing items in the shopping cart” or
		“add to cart” Upon checkout the software typically calculates a total
		for the order, including shipping and handling (i.e., postage and
		packing) charges and the associated taxes, as applicable. </font>

				<h3>Shopping Cart</h3> <font color="blue"> <p>A shopping cart is
					a piece of software that acts as an online store's catalog and
					ordering process. Typically, a shopping cart is the interface
					between a company's Web siteand its deeper infrastructure, allowing
					consumers to select merchandise; review what they have selected;
					make necessary modifications or additions; and purchase the
					merchandise.</p> Shopping carts can be sold as independent pieces of
					software so companies can integrate them into their own unique
					online solution, or they can be offered as a feature from a service
					that will create and host a company's e-commercesite. </font>
